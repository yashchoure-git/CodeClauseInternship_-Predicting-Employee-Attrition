# Predicting Employee Attrition

## Overview
Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations, as it affects productivity, workforce stability, and overall business performance. This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques by analyzing various employee-related factors.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Model training using Machine Learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation and model selection
- Deployment using Streamlit

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Algorithms)
- TensorFlow (Deep Learning, if applicable)
- Streamlit (Web App Deployment)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various employee attributes, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Department
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Work-Life Balance
- Job Satisfaction
- Years at Company
- Attrition (Target Variable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predicting-Employee-Attrition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Predicting-Employee-Attrition
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and Model Training.
2. Deploy the model using Streamlit:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Interact with the web app to predict employee attrition based on input features.

## Model Performance
The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate deep learning models for better accuracy
- Implement feature selection techniques
- Deploy the model on cloud platforms
